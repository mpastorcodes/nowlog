# Nowlog

Nowlog is a tiny, focused tool. Not a journal. Not a planner. Not a tracker. Just a quiet place to log a moment — and move on.

## What is Nowlog?

One field. One button. One log at a time.

### Why?

- Because attention is scarce.
- Because reflection doesn't need features.
- Because we forget what "now" felt like.

### Nowlog is:

- **Fast** – loads instantly, no distractions
- **Clean** – no formatting, no tags, no options
- **Private** – your moments are yours
- **Small** – mobile-first, works offline
- **Honest** – no dopamine loops, no likes, no gamification

It's not about writing more. It's about showing up. Noticing. Pausing. A habit of presence, one log at a time.

Like a breath. Log it. Done.

## Technical Details

Nowlog is built with Ruby on Rails, with a focus on simplicity and speed. It includes:

- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline use
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Keyboard shortcuts for faster logging (press Enter to submit)
- Dark mode support based on system preferences
